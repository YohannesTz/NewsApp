# NewsApp
This is a simple News app made in Android Java. (Me from the future:- I made this project hoping to become
a good Android developer. It has the essentials in it. Recyeclerview, Api Request, Serializations, etc...
I also had to make the backend for it using php. if you are interested check it out too [here](https://github.com/YohannesTz/newsapp-backend). it has been now a really old project. 
I don't see myself getting back to it. but if it helps you drop a star!
